    "## Using the `__lab__()` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For a streamlined repository setup experience within JupyterLab, the `gcpds.docs` package offers a convenient function `__lab__()` that initializes the process through an integrated graphical user interface (GUI). This GUI simplifies common Git operations, allowing both novice and experienced users to manage their repository with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin the setup process, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open JupyterLab**: Start by opening your JupyterLab environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Import the Module**: In a Jupyter notebook cell, import the required function from the `gcpds.docs` package:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from gcpds.docs import __lab__\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialize the GUI**: Execute the function to open the GUI:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   __lab__()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clone the Repository**: \n",
    "   - In the GUI, enter your repository's URL in the designated field.\n",
    "   - Click the 'Clone' button to clone the repository to your JupyterLab environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "![border-image](_images/lab_01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Access Repository Management Options**:\n",
    "   - After cloning, execute the `__lab__()` function once more:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     __lab__()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This action will refresh the GUI and provide you with buttons for 'Status', 'Pull', 'Push', and 'Commit' operations.\n",
    "   - Manage your repository by using these options. Enter your commit messages in the interface and confirm your actions with the respective buttons.\n",
    "  \n",
    "![border-image](_images/lab_02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `__lab__()` function, you can access a user-friendly interface for common Git operations directly within JupyterLab, making it an ideal tool for those who prefer a more visual approach to repository management."
