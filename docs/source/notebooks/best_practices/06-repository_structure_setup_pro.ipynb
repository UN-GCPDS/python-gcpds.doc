    "## Writing Your Python Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a Python module involves writing a Python script with functions, classes, or variables. Here's a basic guide on how to create a simple Python module.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Python File**: \n",
    "   - Create a new file with a `.py` extension within your `DOCS_MODULE` or `DOCS_SUBMODULE` directory.\n",
    "   - For example, if creating a module named `example`, your file would be `example.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Writing Module Content**:\n",
    "   - Open the file in a text editor or an IDE.\n",
    "   - Start defining your functions, classes, or variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example Python Module**:\n",
    "   - Below is a basic example of a Python module that contains a simple function.\n",
    "  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# example.py\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function greets the person whose name is passed as a parameter\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(greet(\"World\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using the Module**:\n",
    "   - You can use this module by importing it into other Python scripts.\n",
    "   - Here is an example of how to import and use the `greet` function from the `example.py` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# another_script.py\n",
    "\n",
    "from example import greet\n",
    "\n",
    "print(greet(\"User\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a basic template for creating a Python module. You can expand it with more complex functionality, classes, and error handling as needed for your project. Remember to follow good coding practices, such as clear commenting and consistent naming conventions, to ensure your code is easily understandable and maintainable."

    "\n",
    "1. **`automated-setup.yml`**: This workflow automatically creates the `setup.py` file for your Python project.\n",
    "2. **`automated-sphinx-docs.yml`**: This workflow sets up a Sphinx environment automatically for your documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `automated-setup.yml` could be a workflow for setting up your project environment, and `automated-sphinx-docs.yml` could be for building and deploying Sphinx documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the workflow files must be written in YAML format and correctly configured to match your project's needs. The specific contents of these files will depend on the tasks you want to automate."
